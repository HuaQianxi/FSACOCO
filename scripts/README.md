# MM-Labels to darknet

A quick tool to convert the label format of the labeling tool to Darknet YOLO format.

# How to use?

No command line parameters. Just change the variables **idir**, **odir**, **width** and **height** and run the python file.
By default, **red cones** will be mapped to class index **0**, **blue** to class **1**, **big-orange** to **2**, though of course you can also change that.
